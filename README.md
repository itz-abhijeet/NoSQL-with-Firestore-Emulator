# NoSQL-with-Firestore-Emulator
NoSQL with Firestore Emulator allows developers to locally test and build applications without connecting to the live Google Cloud Firestore service. It simulates Firestoreâ€™s NoSQL database features, enabling faster development, offline testing, and safe experimentation. This helps reduce costs and avoids accidental changes in production data.
